# KNN-implementation-with-mathmetics
its the best algorithm to classify a sample to which category it belongs 
its based on calculating the distence between user_sample and allothersamples of dataset 
on the basis of value of k it takes k minimum samples having the minimum distence calculated by algo and which class having the max 
repitition values in the selected k sample will be the most belonging category of the class
